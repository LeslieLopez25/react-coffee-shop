<h1>The Sunrise Cafe :sunny:</h1>

<h2>A Coffee Shop React Website Using Styled Components. </h2>

<p>This website is responsive using flexbox, grid, and CSS custom properties. I had a fun creating this. I used the project of the pizza website that is in my github as the skeleton to this project. Screenshots of what the website looks like.</p>
